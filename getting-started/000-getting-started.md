Getting Started with Mapzen Search
===================================

Mapzen Search is a modern geocoding and place search service based on [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias), an experimental open geocoder from [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com) and powered by open data. It's used to transform the way people talk about places - with names and addresses - into geographic coordinates.

Mapzen Search can be used to:
- geocode addresses, points of interest, neighborhoods, cities, and regions
- power real-time search autocomplete for places
- turn a list of addresses into coordinates to plot
- Take location coordinates and turn them into human readable places, like an address
- find the neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries of location coordinates to quickly classify where your data is coming from

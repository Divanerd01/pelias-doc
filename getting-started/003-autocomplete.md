# Search with autocomplete

If you are building an end-user application, you can enable `/autocomplete` alongside the `/search` to add real-time feedback to help users find what they are looking for more easily, without requiring them to type the entire search term. Typically, the user starts typing and a drop-down list appears where they can choose the term from the list.
